 # Description -->> 
  This project is a fully functional Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for an e-commerce platform, built as part of Task 4 for the CodTech Web Development Internship. The goal of this task was to create a modern, lightweight, and responsive e-commerce application that can work offline and support push notifications — providing users with a seamless and app-like shopping experience directly from the browser.

# Key Features
# Progressive Web App (PWA)
Works offline using Service Workers and Cache API.

Can be installed to the user's device like a native app.

Fast and responsive even on poor networks.

# Login Page
Simple and clean login UI with email and password fields.

Redirects to the main shopping page upon login.

Responsive design ensures it looks good on mobile and desktop.

# Product Catalog
Displays a list of sample products (e.g., T-shirt, Watch, Shoes).

Each product card includes title, price, and an “Add to Cart” button (non-functional for now).

Product listing is generated dynamically using vanilla JavaScript.

# Push Notifications
Browser push notification is triggered on login (with permission).

Welcomes the user with a notification about the PWA experience.

Uses Service Worker’s showNotification() method.

# Service Workers
Static assets like HTML, CSS, JS, and images are cached on the first load.

Enables full offline browsing of the website.

Fetches resources from cache first, then network (if available).

# Responsive Design
Clean and modern UI using basic HTML & CSS Grid/Flexbox layout.

Fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Supports touch-friendly buttons and form fields.

# PWA Manifest
Configured with metadata such as app name, theme color, icons, and start URL.

Allows the app to be added to home screen with its own icon and splash screen.

Custom icons included (192x192 and 512x512) for install support.
